Useful things to remember:

You can use py manage.py check to quickly see if code will run or has syntax errors or other fatal failures

Access the site locally by localhost:8000
	!Need to run it from a git console first by py manage.py runserver
	also use a private browsing mode like incognitoon chrome if you are making changes to static files

current admin account credentials:
username: admin
password: ApinaVapina

Access admin page by appending /admin to url

git commands:
git pull - downloads newest version from master branch
git status - see changes you've made
git add - add files to a commit
git commit -m "ebin :D" - creates a commit of added changes with the cited message 
git push - pushes made changes to master branch repository
git checkout <filepath> - permanently disregards changes in this file compared to master branch


you can install most python libraries by git console with the command:
pip install <library name>

really hard :(
